# **_Protectly_**

_Published September 2022_

**_Protectly_** is a full stack web application that allows users to limit their Calendly meetings to only emails on our database. Combining an easy to use modern flow with a robust and reliable back end database, we secure users Calendly links.

**Important Note:** While _Protectly_ is free to use, a paid _Calendly_ Account is required on the Professional Tier to use this service. Please visit Calendly's Pricing Page for more information.

## How **_Protectly_** Works

---

### Website Overview

**_Protectly_** utilizes a front-end library consisting of React and Redux, styled with CSS, SCSS, and MUI and a backend Node.js/Express/Sequelize server and database.

Users connect their _Calendly_ account to create a webhook that will fire every time a meeting is scheduled using their link. Users will then add as many emails to their _Protectly_ account that are approved to schedule meetings.

Each time a meeting is scheduled _Calendly_ will check our database, if the invitee is not in the Users list, _Calendly_ will automatically cancel the meeting. Users can also customize their cancel message that is tied to the _Calendly_ cancellation email sent to the invitee and them.

### Website Features

Here are some of the website's features in greater detail:

- A modern and simple design that utilizes MUI framework.
- Users can add emails along with the name associated with the email as well as notes to remind them of that user.
- Users can delete emails from their list if that email should no longer be allowed
- Users can also customize their message that is sent on their behalf by _Calendly's_ webhook to _Protectly_

## **_Protectly_** In Development

This website is the final capstone project of our DigitalCrafts Full Stack Boot Camp. **_Protectly_** is intended to demonstrate a clear understanding of using React.js and Redux as front-end libraries, as well as a Node.js backend. This site is ready to use in real world applications and we as a group plan to bring this to users who can benefit from this software.

Our future plans for **_Protectly_**:

- Dark Mode
- Ability to sort the approved list
- Ability to search the approved list
- Set timers on the approved list so they are automatically removed after a set time frame
- Having different lists for different links associated with the user rather than for all links under the account
- Being able to set up team environments similar to _Calendly's_ systems
